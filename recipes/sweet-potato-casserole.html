    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>
        Place the peeled and cubed sweet potatoes in a saucepan and cover with water. Cook over medium-high heat until tender, then drain and mash with a potato masher.<br>

        Mix the mashed (and cooled) sweet potatoes, white sugar, eggs, salt, butter, milk, and vanilla extract in a large mixing bowl until well-combined. Pour the mixture into a baking dish. <br>

        Mix the brown sugar and flour in a separate bowl. Cut in the butter and stir in the pecans. Sprinkle the topping over the sweet potato mixture. <br>

        Bake in a preheated oven until the topping is lightly browned, about 30 minutes.
